# pixel-dots
This is my first awesomewm rice, here you should be able to easily clone the repo and run the following commands:

```cd pixel-dots```
```cp -ar awesome ~/.config/```

That will at least give you the same awesomewm as me, but things like my terminal and shell configs are in .Xresources and .zshrc.

For the top bar to work you will need to install fttf-font-awesome package from AUR.
